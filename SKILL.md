# Market Signal Analysis

## Mission

Produce horizon-specific, causal, probability-aware market decision support. Explain what is observed, what is inferred, what could change the view, and which evidence matters most. Do not turn indicators, narratives, or policy motives into certainty.

## First Principles

1. **Gate on data quality.** Verify symbol, market, timestamp, frequency, range, adjustment status, missing fields, and source freshness. If essential data is missing or stale, narrow the claim or withhold numeric probabilities.
2. **Fix the horizon before selecting signals.** Intraday, short, medium, and long horizons use different data, actors, transmission speeds, and invalidation levels. Use `us_equity` only when the market is genuinely U.S. equity or unspecified; otherwise read `references/market-profiles.md`.
3. **Separate state, flow, and expectation.** Valuation and leverage are states; fund flows and earnings revisions are flows; policy promises and narratives are expectations. A vulnerable state is not a timing signal without a flow or catalyst.
4. **Build the causal chain before using correlation.** Identify driver -> transmission -> market variable -> price/earnings effect -> confirmation. Treat correlation, Fourier coherence, and historical analogies as supporting evidence unless a plausible mechanism exists.
5. **Prefer revealed action to unsupported language.** Compare dated words with costly, repeated, scalable, and hard-to-reverse actions within the actor's control. Preserve principal-agent, desk, subsidiary, mandate, and balance-sheet distinctions.
6. **Use independent evidence and base rates.** Group correlated indicators, cap duplicate weight, condition priors on market and regime, and shrink small samples. Label probabilities as empirical, model-implied, or scenario weights.
7. **Model paths, not isolated targets.** Give a horizon, catalyst or transmission path, range, probability, and invalidation condition. A point target without a path and time window is low-value precision.
8. **Try to disprove the preferred view.** State the strongest opposing explanation and observable evidence that would change the conclusion. Do not average genuine contradictions into a false neutral.
9. **Use the minimum sufficient model.** Load one primary module and normally no more than two overlays. Add another module only when it can materially change the decision, probability, or risk boundary.
10. **Keep analysis non-guaranteed.** Distinguish market analysis from personalized financial advice and account for costs, slippage, liquidity, leverage, and gap risk when relevant.

## Workflow

1. Frame the target, market, asset type, decision horizon, and user's actual question.
2. Run the data gate. Record source, as-of time, adjustment status, sample length, and material omissions.
3. Select the minimum primary module and overlays from the routing table.
4. Build an evidence ledger with four labels: verified observation, estimated value, inference, and scenario assumption.
5. Classify the regime and write the shortest causal transmission chain that explains the relevant price path.
6. Score only decision-relevant, sufficiently independent evidence. Use `references/statistical-weighting.md` for quantitative probabilities and calibration.
7. Compare the base case with at least one credible opposing case. Run actor deviation, regime-change, and event-risk checks when applicable.
8. Deliver the conclusion first, then evidence, scenarios, levels or time windows, and explicit update/invalidation triggers. Use `references/output-format.md` for structured or complex answers.

## Composition Rules

- Treat technicals as timing and path evidence, fundamentals as cash-flow and valuation evidence, liquidity as discount-rate and marginal-demand evidence, and actor analysis as a scenario prior. Do not substitute one family for another.
- For policy or actor questions, compare words versus actions and model direct and second-round strategic responses. Call an equilibrium stable only after a unilateral-deviation test and observable confirmation.
- For bubble regimes, separate "expensive but strengthening" from "expensive and weakening." Valuation can define fragility; breadth, flows, revisions, credit, and failed price structure usually determine timing.
- For cycles and Fourier analysis, use rolling, regime-aware evidence. When HP or BK filtering is used, disclose parameters and causal versus two-sided construction, treat symmetric endpoints as descriptive only, and do not count the filter and the FFT of its output as independent evidence. Long cycles and spectral peaks adjust priors or confidence; they do not independently cause price moves.
- For official data, decompose components, definitions, revisions, base effects, and independent proxies before raising confidence.
- For ETF-flow inference, aggregate peer ETFs by exposure, use share changes rather than AUM changes, separate secondary-market selling from primary-market redemption, and never identify a seller from shares alone.
- When evidence families conflict, preserve the conflict, explain which horizon each governs, and widen ranges or lower confidence.

## Minimum Output Contract

Lead with the answer. State the as-of time and horizon, data quality, regime, causal chain, strongest supporting and opposing evidence, probability type, base/upside/downside scenarios, relevant levels or time windows, and observable invalidation/update triggers. Match the user's language. Never fabricate precision when the data cannot support it.

## Scripts

Use `scripts/analyze_ohlcv.py` for CSV OHLCV analysis. Expected columns are `timestamp,open,high,low,close,volume`; case-insensitive aliases are accepted. Add `--calendar events.csv` when a known event calendar is available.

```powershell
python scripts/analyze_ohlcv.py --input prices.csv --market us_equity --horizon short
```

Use `scripts/analyze_etf_flows.py` for daily A/H-share ETF share/flow, crowding, unwind, and three-state Bayesian scenario analysis. Read the market-specific ETF reference for the input schema and interpretation limits.

```powershell
python scripts/analyze_etf_flows.py --input etf_daily.csv --scope broad --group csi300
```

Add `--market hk` for canonical fund-level Hong Kong data. Do not pass repeated multi-counter units as separate funds.

Use `scripts/train_market_transformer_demo.py` only for a requested trainable-model demo. It expects panel data with `timestamp,symbol,market,open,high,low,close,volume` plus optional numeric features.

```powershell
python scripts/train_market_transformer_demo.py --input panel_daily_features.csv --lookback 256 --horizon 1 --epochs 5
```

Run `scripts/validate_skill_graph.py` after changing the skill architecture.
