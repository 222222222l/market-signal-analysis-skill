# Trend Stage Analysis

Use this reference when the user asks whether a trend is ending, where an uptrend/downtrend would be invalidated, how to judge a stage trend, whether to hold a main-trend position, or how to combine Vegas channel, moving averages, ATR stops, Donchian levels, momentum, volume, and relative strength.

Do not claim that any indicator has a permanently highest win rate. Treat "best" indicators as regime-dependent evidence. Use historically robust priors, then adjust by asset type, liquidity, volatility, market structure, and available backtest samples.

## Data Requirements

- Minimum: 252 daily OHLCV bars for ordinary daily trend analysis.
- Preferred: 676+ daily bars for full Vegas long-cycle channels; 104+ weekly bars for long-horizon confirmation.
- For ETFs, indices, and liquid stocks, require adjusted prices when dividends/splits matter.
- For A-shares, disclose price-limit, T+1, suspension, policy-theme, and northbound/fund-flow caveats when relevant.
- For low-liquidity or frequently suspended assets, reduce confidence before scoring trend evidence.

## Trend Stage Taxonomy

Classify the asset into one primary stage and one transition risk:

| Stage | Typical Evidence | Practical Read |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Base / accumulation | Price oscillates around flat MA50/MA120; Vegas channel flat; volatility compresses; volume does not confirm breakdowns. | Direction is not proven. Wait for reclaim/breakout or use range rules. |
| Early trend reversal | Price reclaims MA50/MA120; MA20 and MA50 turn up; MACD repairs toward/above zero; relative strength improves. | Trend is improving, but failure risk remains high until pullbacks hold. |
| Healthy uptrend | Price above rising MA20/MA50/MA120 and daily Vegas channel; pullbacks hold MA20/MA50; RSI often holds 40-50 zone; volume expands on advances and contracts on pullbacks. | Main trend is intact. Prefer staged holding and pullback adds over chasing exhaustion. |
| Main acceleration / parabolic | Price far above MA20/MA50/Vegas; ATR expands; RSI stays elevated; breadth and leadership must confirm. | Vegas becomes too slow for risk control. Use MA20, MA50, ATR, and failed-breakout rules first. |
| Distribution / fatigue | New highs narrow; MACD/RSI divergence; high-volume stagnation; repeated failed breakouts; MA20 is lost and not quickly reclaimed. | Uptrend may still exist, but payoff becomes asymmetric. Reduce reliance on old momentum. |
| Trend break | Close below MA50/MA120 or Vegas channel with failed recovery; weekly confirmation strengthens the signal. | Treat as trend damage, not just noise, especially if relative strength and volume also deteriorate. |
| Downtrend | Price below falling MA20/MA50/MA120; Vegas turns down; rallies fail at MA20/MA50; relative strength remains weak. | Do not use oversold alone as a buy signal. Require reversal structure. |

## Indicator Families and Default Weights

Use this trend-stage weighting when the user's primary question is trend direction, trend ending, stage classification, or position-level invalidation. Keep the general probability framework in statistical-weighting.md for ordinary buy/sell/hold calls.

| Family | Default Weight | What To Check |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Trend structure and MA stack | 0.25 | Price vs MA20/50/120/200, MA slopes, higher highs/lows, pullback behavior. |
| Vegas channel | 0.20 | Daily EMA144/169 main channel, EMA576/676 long-cycle background, channel slope, recover/fail behavior. |
| Momentum and relative strength | 0.15 | 3/6/12-month momentum, benchmark/sector/peer relative strength, persistence during market pullbacks. |
| Breakout and support structure | 0.12 | Donchian 20/55 highs/lows, failed breakouts, prior pivot support/resistance, gap/limit zones. |
| Volume and turnover confirmation | 0.10 | Breakout volume, pullback volume contraction, distribution volume, turnover heat and fund-flow stress. |
| MACD/RSI/KDJ confirmation | 0.10 | MACD zero-line regime, histogram acceleration, RSI regime, divergence, oscillator failure swings. |
| Volatility and ATR trailing risk | 0.08 | ATR expansion, Chandelier exits, Bollinger expansion/squeeze, gap risk, stop distance. |

Weights must sum to 1.0 after asset-specific adjustment. Penalize duplicate evidence: MA20 loss, 20-day low, and 2ATR Chandelier can point to the same short-term damage and should not all receive full independent credit.

## Asset-Specific Adjustments

For broad indices and index ETFs:
- Raise MA/Vegas/multi-timeframe structure weight.
- Raise breadth and constituent participation when available.
- Lower single-instrument volume weight because ETF volume can reflect creation/redemption and hedging.

For liquid single stocks:
- Keep MA/Vegas/RS as core evidence.
- Raise volume/turnover and event-risk penalties around earnings, guidance, lock-up expiry, major policy/news catalysts, or insider selling.

For A-share themes, sectors, and high-beta growth boards:
- Raise MA20/MA50, ATR trailing, breadth, turnover heat, and failed-breakout evidence.
- Reduce reliance on Vegas for timing in fast policy/theme bubbles; use Vegas mainly for formal main-trend invalidation.
- Treat limit-up/limit-down clustering, financing balance, northbound/fund flows, sector breadth, and policy narrative decay as important context.

For commodities, futures, and crypto:
- Raise volatility, ATR, liquidation/funding, term structure, inventory, and macro-liquidity evidence.
- Use Vegas mainly on daily/weekly trend context, not as the only stop mechanism.
- Require wider noise bands because 24/7 trading and leverage liquidations can create false breaks.

For low-liquidity small caps:
- Reduce overall confidence.
- Discount volume spikes that may be one-off or manipulation-prone.
- Require more confirmation from weekly structure and recover/fail behavior.

## Vegas Channel Rules

Use daily EMA144 and EMA169 as the main Vegas trend channel. Use EMA576 and EMA676 as long-cycle bull/bear background when enough data exists.

Bullish main-trend conditions:
- Price is above EMA144/169.
- EMA144/169 channel is rising or flattening upward.
- Pullbacks into the channel recover quickly.
- MA50/MA120 are rising or not yet damaged.

Warning conditions:
- Price approaches the EMA144/169 channel after a large extension above MA20/MA50.
- Price loses MA50 before testing Vegas.
- Relative strength turns down before price breaks Vegas.
- A pullback into the channel is accompanied by expanding down-volume or broad sector deterioration.

Formal daily trend-end rule:
- A close below the lower side of EMA144/169, followed by failure to recover within 2-3 sessions, is a daily main-trend break.
- A weekly close below the daily Vegas channel or below the corresponding weekly trend structure gives stronger confirmation.
- If price breaks below Vegas but immediately reclaims it on strong volume and relative strength, classify it as a bear trap / false break candidate rather than a confirmed trend end.

Do not wait for Vegas in parabolic or high-beta trends. By the time price reaches EMA144/169, a large drawdown may already have occurred.

## Fast-Trend Risk Stack

When price is far above Vegas, stage risk controls from fast to slow:

| Layer | Typical Rule | Interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First warning | Lose MA20, close below 2ATR Chandelier, or fail to reclaim a short breakout level. | Momentum cooling; not necessarily trend end. |
| Strong warning | Lose 3ATR Chandelier, 20-day low, or repeated MA20 reclaim failures. | Acceleration phase likely ending. Reduce chase behavior. |
| Mid-trend break | Lose MA50, 55-day low, or key pivot with expanding down-volume. | Swing/intermediate trend is damaged. |
| Formal main-trend end | Lose EMA144/169, MA120/MA200, or weekly structure with failed recovery. | Main trend likely ended or entered a larger correction. |

For long-term holders, separate "take-profit/risk reduction" from "formal trend end." Fast-layer breaks can justify reducing exposure even while the main Vegas trend is technically intact.

## Auxiliary Indicator Rules

- MA stack: healthy uptrends usually have price > MA20 > MA50 > MA120 > MA200 with upward slopes. Slope matters more than the mere cross.
- Donchian: 20-day lows are short-term risk markers; 55-day lows are stronger trend-damage markers. Breakouts that fail within 3-5 sessions are bearish evidence.
- Chandelier Exit: use highest high over 20 or 60 sessions minus 2ATR/3ATR. The 2ATR level is earlier but noisier; 3ATR is slower but more robust.
- MACD: above-zero MACD supports trend continuation; below-zero crosses after extended runs are more serious than isolated signal-line crosses.
- RSI: overbought is not a sell signal in strong trends. In healthy uptrends RSI often holds above 40-50; repeated breaks below 40 are trend-damage evidence.
- Volume: bullish breakouts should expand volume; pullbacks should contract volume. Heavy down-volume after failed highs is distribution evidence.
- Relative strength: a market leader should resist benchmark drawdowns and recover faster. If absolute price is rising but relative strength is falling, downgrade trend quality.
- Breadth: for sectors/themes, track the share of constituents above MA20/50/120, equal-weight versus cap-weighted performance, and whether gains rely on one or two leaders.

## Weighted Trend Dashboard

Use a dashboard instead of a single indicator verdict:

```text
趋势阶段：健康上升 / 加速主升 / 分歧派发 / 趋势破位 ...
综合趋势分：0-100
短线动能分：0-100
中期趋势分：0-100
长期背景分：0-100
趋势结束置信度：低 / 中 / 高
```

Suggested score interpretation:

| Score | Read |
| ---: | --- |
| 75-100 | Strong trend; only fast-layer risk controls may be active. |
| 60-74 | Uptrend intact but needs confirmation; avoid aggressive chasing if extended. |
| 45-59 | Mixed / transition zone; wait for reclaim or breakdown confirmation. |
| 30-44 | Trend damaged; rallies need proof. |
| 0-29 | Downtrend or failed trend; reversal requires new evidence. |

## Output Format for Trend Questions

When the user asks a trend-stage or trend-end question, include:

1. Data, horizon, and confidence.
2. Trend stage classification.
3. Key levels table:
   - short warning level
   - strong warning level
   - mid-trend break level
   - formal main-trend end level
4. Weighted indicator dashboard.
5. Bullish evidence and bearish/risk evidence.
6. What would upgrade the trend and what would downgrade it.
7. Risk-control language for the user's horizon.

Use cautious phrasing:

```text
当前更像是“加速后的回撤风险上升”，还不是“主趋势已经结束”。
若连续 2-3 个交易日无法收回 Vegas 下沿，才更接近日线主趋势结束。
若跌破 MA20/2ATR，只说明短线动能退潮；若再跌破 MA50/55日低点，中期趋势才明显受损。
```

Avoid:

```text
必然见顶
这个指标胜率最高所以一定有效
跌破某一条均线就无条件清仓
```
